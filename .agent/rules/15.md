# Clipboard Brain — Definition of Done (DoD)

## 1. Purpose of This Document

This document defines the minimum quality bar for:

- Individual tasks
- Features
- Milestones
- MVP release

No task or feature is considered complete unless all applicable criteria are satisfied.

---

---

## 2. Levels of Done

There are four levels of completion:

1. Task Done
2. Feature Done
3. Milestone Done
4. MVP Done

Each level builds on the previous one.

---

---

## 3. Task Done Criteria

A task is considered DONE when:

### Code Quality

- ✅ Code compiles without errors.
- ✅ No analyzer warnings.
- ✅ No unused imports or dead code.
- ✅ Naming follows conventions.
- ✅ Files placed in correct folders.
- ✅ No architecture violations.

---

### Behavior

- ✅ Functionality matches requirements exactly.
- ✅ Edge cases handled.
- ✅ Error handling implemented.
- ✅ No regressions introduced.

---

### Documentation

- ✅ Public APIs documented.
- ✅ Complex logic commented.
- ✅ README updated if needed.

---

### Testing

- ✅ Unit tests added where applicable.
- ✅ Tests pass locally.
- ✅ No skipped tests.

---

## 4. Feature Done Criteria

A feature is DONE when:

- ✅ All related tasks are DONE.
- ✅ Integrated with UI correctly.
- ✅ Works in debug and release builds.
- ✅ Performance acceptable.
- ✅ No blocking UX issues.
- ✅ No crashes or exceptions.

---

---

## 5. Milestone Done Criteria

A milestone is DONE when:

- ✅ All features in milestone are DONE.
- ✅ Manual regression testing completed.
- ✅ No critical bugs.
- ✅ Build succeeds on clean machine.
- ✅ Docs updated.
- ✅ Architecture remains compliant.

---

---

## 6. MVP Done Criteria

The MVP is DONE when:

- ✅ All product requirements implemented.
- ✅ Privacy guarantees met.
- ✅ Performance requirements met.
- ✅ Stable for daily use.
- ✅ No known critical bugs.
- ✅ Installable release build.
- ✅ Basic user documentation exists.

---

---

## 7. Performance Acceptance

- App launch < 2 seconds.
- Clipboard capture latency < 100ms.
- Search response < 200ms (5k items).
- Idle CPU usage minimal.

---

---

## 8. Stability Acceptance

- App runs 24h without crash.
- Memory stable.
- Native plugin stable.

---

---

## 9. Security Acceptance
